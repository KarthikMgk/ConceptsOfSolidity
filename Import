Import keyword is incorporated into a language to reduce code redudancy

contract mobile{
  function super() public pure {
    return "return something"
  }
}


import "./mobile.sol"
contract phone{
  function sub() pure public {
    return "Again return something"
  }
}

Considering the above two contracts are in two fdifferent files in the same directory, We can use the import statement to get function inside another function
