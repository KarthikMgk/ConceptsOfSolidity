Lets take about Inheritance.

Inheritance is one of the words we usually use in object oriented programming.
Inheritance is similar to that in OOP 

If you are familiar with any OOP lang, Contract is the equivalent of class in OOP lang



contract solidity1{
  function superclass() public pure returns(string){
    return "This is a superclass";
  }
}

contract solidity2 is solidity1{
  function subclass()public pure returns(string){
    return "This is a subclass";
  }
}

Line 16 we use 'is' keyword which basically means we are inherting former contract from latter one
