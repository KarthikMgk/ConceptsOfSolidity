Require is an important functionality in Solidity. Its basically used for access control

contract solidity{
  function sayHi(string _name) pure {
    require(keccak256(_name) == keccak256("karthik"));
    return "Hi karthik";
  }
}

Line 5 Only if keccak256 of value stored in _name variable matches keccak256 of karthik which is the username, function returns Hi else throws error
